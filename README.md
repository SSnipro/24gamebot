#### Rules

###### Welcome to Noah's 24-point game!
    
> Your goal is to try to use four numbers given to calculate 24.

> Each card must be only used once, it cannot be reused (Also, negative numbers are not allowed!). 

> You cannot combine numbers (for example, if you have 1 & 4 you cannot just combine it and make 14)

> You can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses (please don't use unnecessary parentheses).

###### Examples of correct and incorrect answers:
    
    The four numbers are: [3,8,2,1]

Incorrect answer 1:

    (3 * 8) * 1

> You must use all four numbers.

Incorrect answer 2:

    - 2 + 1 * (3 * 8)

> We do not tolerate negative numbers. There will be too many answers!

Incorrect answer 3:

    (3 * 8 * (2 - 1))

> The parentheses outside are not nessasary.

Incorrect answer 4:

    3 + 8 + 2 - 1

> The four numbers do not add up to 24!

Correct answer: 

    3 * 8 * (2 - 1)

#### Rankings in Leaderboards

--------------

###### First answers

The first answers will be based on time. The faster you answer correctly, the higher you are on the leaderboard.

This is the formation:

    --------------------
    Correct answers so far:

    「🥇 𝗚𝗼𝗹𝗱」Noah  ✔︎  (8/8)*(8*3) ⏱ (0:00:28)
    「🥈 𝗦𝗶𝗹𝘃𝗲𝗿」Sichengthebest  ✔︎  (8*3)+8-8 ⏱ (0:00:45)
    「🥉 𝗕𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘇𝗲」Sichengthebest  ✔︎  8*3+8-8 ⏱ (0:00:54)

###### gameQ Leaderboard

The gameQ leaderboard first ranks the correct answers of each user. If two users have the same number of correct answers, then it will be based on the number of errors between the two users (the lower errors the better)

This is the formation:

    --------------------
    Personal Rankings:

    「🏆 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗶𝗼𝗻」 ✨ Sichengthebest | ✅ 2 Correct Answers ❌ 0 Errors
    「🎖 𝗪𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗿」 ✨ Noah | ✅ 1 Correct Answer ❌ 0 Errors
    「🏅 𝗩𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿」 ✨ 老房东 | ✅ 0 Correct Answers ❌ 1 Error

###### Lifetime Leaderboard

The lifetime leaderboard has the same ranking system as the gameQ leaderboard. The only difference is that the gameQ leaderboard refreshes each game, but the lifetime leaderboard indicates the total amount of correct and incorrect answers of a user.

This is the formation:

    「🏆 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗶𝗼𝗻」 ✨ Noah | ✅ 147 Correct Answers ❌ 38 Errors
    「🎖 𝗪𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗿」 ✨ Sichengthebest | ✅ 70 Correct Answers ❌ 45 Errors

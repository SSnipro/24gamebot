#### Rules

###### Welcome to Noah's 24-point game!
    
> Your goal is to try to use four numbers given to calculate 24.

> Each card must be only used once, it cannot be reused (Also, negative numbers are not allowed!). 

> You cannot combine numbers (for example, if you have 1 & 4 you cannot just combine it and make 14)

> You can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses (please don't use unnecessary parentheses).

###### Examples of correct and incorrect answers:
    
    The four numbers are: [3,8,2,1]

Incorrect answer 1:

    (3 * 8) * 1

> You must use all four numbers.

Incorrect answer 2:

    - 2 + 1 * (3 * 8)

> We do not tolerate negative numbers. There will be too many answers!

Incorrect answer 3:

    (3 * 8 * (2 - 1))

> The parentheses outside are not nessasary.

Incorrect answer 4:

    3 + 8 + 2 - 1

> The four numbers do not add up to 24!

Correct answer: 

    3 * 8 * (2 - 1)
